# tribble-tracker
JavaScript including D3.js is used to load a dataset into a table, which can then be filtered with a function that checks the given parameters.

Level 1:
This is a simpler version of the intended design. The table is filtered by only the 'Date' column.

Level 2:
Dropdown filters include options for Date, City, State, Country, and Shape.

The reset button completely refreshes any changed elements in the document without needing to reload the page.
